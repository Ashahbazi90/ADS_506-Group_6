## Project Overview

### Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to understand household electricity usage, which could potentially lead to cost savings and smarter energy utilization. By analyzing the data, forecasts about future electricity usage can be made, simplifying planning for future needs. Additionally, optimizing energy usage can help in reducing the environmental footprint. This project also serves as a learning platform for data analysis while sharing valuable insights on energy consumption with others.

### Problem Statement

The primary objective of this project is to analyze time-series data on household energy consumption to decipher usage trends, optimize power usage, and advocate for sustainability. The goals include:
- Uncovering past consumption trends and peak usage times.
- Developing time-series forecasting models for better planning.
- Identifying cost-saving opportunities.
- Reducing environmental impact.
- Creating awareness for making informed energy decisions.
- Enhancing data analysis skills through real-world data engagement, contributing to both personal and professional growth.

## Dataset Information

### Dataset Title

Household Energy Data - Time Series

### Dataset Description

The dataset has been sourced from Kaggle, under the title "Household Energy Data - Time Series", and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jaganadhg/house-hold-energy-data?select=D202.csv). It comprises data collected from an apartment in San Jose to measure electric usage over time, using a smart meter. The dataset spans from October 22nd, 2016 to October 24th, 2018, with readings taken every 15 minutes. It contains eight attributes: Type, Date, Start time, End time, Usage, Units, Cost, and Notes, with a total of 70368 rows. The data was shared by the energy provider, PG&E, highlighting real-world implications of energy conservation, especially in populous regions like California.

### Initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Findings

The dataset holds potential, especially for electric companies aiming to tailor promotions for selected customers. Preliminary analysis indicates a significant seasonality factor in electric usage, with higher consumption observed during summer, and possibly winter if heating is electric. A potential enhancement could be plotting the time series on a monthly basis instead of daily for a simplified analysis. The extensive and somewhat noisy data was smoothed in an initial plot for better visibility. While the dataset is valuable, a more comprehensive analysis might require data from the entire complex or neighborhood, especially for companies aiming to devise promotional rates or sales prices based on consumption trends.
